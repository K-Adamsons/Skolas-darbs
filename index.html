            <h2>911 Targa 4</h2>
            <p>It’s not cheap, but the new 911 Targa is a lovely thing to look at, is great to drive and in 4S guise also extremely rapid. We’re not totally convinced about the roof down refinement, which does seem to spoil the idea of having a Targa in the first place. But overall this is yet another winner from Porsche, who seems capable of doing very few things wrong nowadays, and in a way that justifies the price.</p>

            <div id="911 Edition 50 Years Porsche Design" class="sportCar">
            <h2>911 Edition 50 Years Porsche Design</h2>
            <p>This particular example is the 911 Targa, which was produced in 2004. What makes it unique is that Targa was by far the rarest of all 996’s body styles; only 5,125 cars were delivered with special opening glass roofs and different C-pillars. Finished in a seductive shade of dark blue with a light-colored interior, this 911 Targa was delivered new in Spain and acquired by the current owner in 2023. It is powered by a 3.6-liter, naturally-aspirated flat-six engine, which is water-cooled (one of the controversies of the 996 generations). However, it has a 6-speed manual transmission, which makes it even rarer and a must-have for any collector of specific 911 models. With 320 hp and a lightweight body, this 911 Targa is ready to jump to 100 km/h (62 mph) in just 5.2 seconds and top 285 km/h (177 mph). Interestingly, the manual-equipped version of this model is significantly quicker than the automatic one, which makes this car even more desirable. The fact that it has all the perks of a convertible, excellent visibility, and an open-air feel with the practicality and comfort of a coupe transforms this blue 911 Targa into a very versatile driver’s machine with an all-important flat-six soundtrack and manual transmission.</p>
